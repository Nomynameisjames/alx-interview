                                    LockBoxes Problem
The LockBoxes problem is a coding challenge that involves manipulating a list of boxes and their corresponding keys in Python.

                                    Problem Description
You are given a list of lockboxes, each containing a list of keys. Some boxes can be unlocked by other boxes' keys,
but not vice versa. Your task is to determine whether all the boxes can be opened by using only the keys contained in the boxes.

The input to your function will be a list of lists. Each list represents a lockbox,
and contains integers that correspond to the keys in that box. The first element in each list is the number of keys in the box.

Solution
To solve the LockBoxes problem, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through each box,
checks if its keys can open any of the remaining boxes, and adds those boxes to a list of opened boxes. If at the end all the boxes have been opened, we return True, otherwise we return False.

                                Conclusion
The LockBoxes problem is a simple but interesting coding challenge that requires careful consideration of how boxes and keys are related.
By implementing the algorithm described above, we can easily determine whether all boxes can be opened or not.
